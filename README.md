# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Instructions

You have been given some data in the ./src/data directory.
They need you to build an interactive project where users will select an Indian city and have their local air quality displayed in cigarettes and particulate matter.
How the users select their city is up to you: editorial have used dropdowns, buttons, maps, and keyword entry autocomplete text fields before. It's your choice.

## Techincal requirements

The task must be served as all flat files so that the solution can scale in a serverless environment - e.g. we would put the HTML, CSS, and JS into S3 and serve statically
The task could use node, npm, webpack, babel etc to compile/transpile into the end project files for deployment. Whatever environment you are comfortable with, but no jquery, please. If you prefer, you can build a webpage by hand - it's up to you.
The project is going to go live in areas that do not have good broadband access, so please pay attention to file size and performance.
Some users may have older phones, so please ensure your code works on IE11 and up.

## Project requirements

Must have:

- Ability for users to choose a city and see air quality in the form of cigarettes and particulate matter (PM2.5)
- all text fields from the data json file displaying in a logical manner
- All production files output into a ./dist folder ready for making live.
  Nice to have:
- A version in hindi (data also supplied in separate JSON file)
- Test cases for your code.

## What we're looking for

Ideally, we're looking for a logical approach to the work, some creativity, beautiful code and a nice output, but we are not expecting a finished product by a long chalk.
Don't spend too long on it. Try and cap it at 4 hours.
This really is an opportunity for us to see how you think, how you organise yourself, how you express yourself. Have fun!

## Submission

Please send your code together with a Readme file explaining how to install/run the project and any other notes as a Zip file or a GitHub repository. Please also confirm that we have received the test (it may get blocked by spam filters).
